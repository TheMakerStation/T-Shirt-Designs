# Files

This repo contains both the graphic file (typically a .svg file) 
and or 
its corresponding CAM file (often a Silhouette .studio file or equivalent)

If you are interested in sharing a project containing a lot of file including jpg and png files, consider creating a separate subfolder
for it in an effort to keep this one from getting too cluttered
