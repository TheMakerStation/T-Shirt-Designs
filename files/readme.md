# Files

This repo contains both the graphic file (typically a .svg file) 
and or 
its corresponding CAM file (often a Silhouette .studio file or equivalent)

If you are interested in sharing a project containing many files including jpg and png files, consider creating a separate subfolder
for it in an effort to keep this one from getting too cluttered

## Notes and Caveats

**Use Descriptive Filenames**

**Some svg files may require custom fonts**  
If you find a custom font missing or svg doesn't look right/good, submit an [issue](https://github.com/TheMakerStation/T-Shirt-Designs/issues)
